HTTP Stress Testing Tool User Guide
Overview

This tool allows you to perform stress testing on a specified URL by sending multiple HTTP requests per second. It is useful for testing the performance and reliability of web servers.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
    The requests library must be installed. You can install it using pip.

Installing Python

    Windows: Download the installer from python.org and follow the installation instructions.
    Linux: Most distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check by running python3 --version in the terminal. If not installed, use your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install python3 for Ubuntu).
    macOS: Python 2.x is pre-installed. You can install Python 3 using Homebrew: brew install python.

Installing the Requests Library

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash

pip install requests

Usage Instructions
Step 1: Save the Script

Copy the provided Python script into a file named v-ddos.py.
Step 2: Open Terminal or Command Prompt

    Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
    Linux/macOS: Open your terminal application.

Step 3: Navigate to the Script Directory

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved v-ddos.py. For example:

bash

cd path/to/your/script

Replace path/to/your/script with the actual path.
Step 4: Run the Script

The script requires two positional arguments: the target URL and the number of requests per second. You can also specify an optional parameter to set the maximum number of retries.
Command Syntax

bash

python3 v-ddos.py <url> <requests_per_second> [--retries <max_retries>]

Example Command

bash

python3 v-ddos.py http://example.com 10 --retries 3

This command will send 10 requests per second to http://example.com, with a maximum of 3 retries.
Step 5: Stop the Test

To stop the stress test, press Ctrl + C in the terminal. The script will terminate and display a message indicating that the stress test has been stopped.
Notes

    Ensure you have permission to perform stress testing on the target URL to avoid any legal issues.
    Be cautious when setting the number of requests per second, as sending too many requests may overload the server and could result in your IP being blocked.

Troubleshooting

    If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure that the requests library is installed correctly.
    If you receive a ConnectionError, check the target URL for correctness and ensure that the server is accessible.

Conclusion

This HTTP stress testing tool is a simple and effective way to test the performance of web servers. By following the instructions above, you can easily set up and run stress tests on your desired URLs.
